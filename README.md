# Diwali_Sales_Analysis
Diwali sales data from a Kaggle platform was analyzed using Python. Pandas were used to read the CSV file containing daily sales figures. NumPy provided statistics on items sold and revenue. Matplotlib line plots showed a sharp rise in items sold and revenue during Diwali week compared to other periods. Category-wise performance was investigated using Pandas groupby and a Matplotlib bar plot revealed the top categories. Seaborn heatmap visualized daily sales of different categories, indicating Electronics saw the highest increase compared to baseline levels during Diwali. Through targeted use of NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn, useful insights were gained into sales trends, top categories and buying behaviour changes around the Diwali festive season.
